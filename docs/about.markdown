My name is Joseph LaFleur, 

I am an Aboriginal Developer. 
 Located In Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada. 
I spent a lot of my youth learning how to hardmod, and hack Video Game consoles. I learned a lot of troubleshooting skills, and wanted to slowly learn more about computers, which has lead me to developing websites. 

I enjoy spending time playing Video Games, Reading Manga, and spoiling my dog.

My great grandmother was a traditional Medicine Woman, and spent a lot of her life talking about the importance of Enviriomentalismm, and the importance of respecting wildlife. 

Those words have always stuck with me.

Thanks for checking me out, 
I hope you have a great day.
