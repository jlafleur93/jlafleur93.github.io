Todays work was just a majority of reading and messing with the minima theme, and doing slight edits to match the edits I want for this website, and other small changes.

Use the following command to find files of your jekyll theme replacing minma with your theme.
```bundle info --path minima  ```

After that I had to grab the posts page, as I wanted to remove the date that was on each page, as the default location was ugly with the changes I've made.
