Hello readers,


Today's work was just a majority of reading and messing with the minima theme, and doing slight edits to match the edits I want for this website, and other small changes.
 
Use the following command to find files of your jekyll theme replacing minma with your theme.
 
 
After that I had to grab the posts page, as I wanted to remove the date that was on each page, as the default location was ugly with the changes I've made.
 
Jekyll's documentation on Themes and Page structure is great, and using SASS is easy.

The only real problem right now, is finding stuff to write about, and typos, plenty of typos.
