Hello readers, 

Today I've been just walking my dog, and watching Better Call Saul on netflix. 
I'm going to be doing a few small style changes later today, as well as work on an front-end for an api project that I have in the works. 

I've been applying for more jobs, and started getting more active with walking again, as I need the energy.

My dog is happy as pie, and she should be, shes an adorable little animal.

Have a great day
