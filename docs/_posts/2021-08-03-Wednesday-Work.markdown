Today was spent mostly just editing small changes again, also my styling on the blog pages was initially broken.
 
As it was having problems finding my stylesheet, I had to change the href to use relative rather than using manual insertion that I had changed my anchor tags to use, as it couldn't find the stylesheet, I fixed this by inserting the stylesheet into the header in the __includes. 
 
Other than that, today was just mostly relaxing with my spoiled little puppy, and feeding her carrots, as my dog is two-spirited, and has the spirit of a rabbit in her, splitting time between dog and rabbit.
