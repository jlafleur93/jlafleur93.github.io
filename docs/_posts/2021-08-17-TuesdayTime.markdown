Hello Readers, 
Today I have been mostly reading about more quality assurance stuff, and going through the projects on freecodecamps section of QA. 
Going through the section has been pretty enjoyable, as most of the work is rather similar to what I did while at bootcamp. 

The basic user setup is rather similar to my TinyApp and the same process of doing a lot of work, then removing and requiring them into the same server setup. 

It's been fun seeing that a lot of the work I did is rather similar to other programs setup. 

Have a great day.
