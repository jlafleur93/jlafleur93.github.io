Hello readers,
 
Today I've been mostly scouting out companies and applying for jobs.
 
I've also been looking at websites around my area and see if I can potentially do better.
 
I have taken graphic design courses but never bothered to think I could pursue them further, despite insistence at the time from my instructor.

anyways have a good day.
