Hi

It's been quite a while since I've last updated my website/blog

so today I thought I would talk about things, I've been watching. 

Recently I watched the George Carlin American Dream, I had a great time relistening to some of my favorite lines of his, and hearing his lifestory and the stories of his family, it was quite sad to know that he left to tour for his book, right before his wife died. 
I'm sure it hurt him. 

I have also watched Everywhere, Everything All At Once. 
It was a great watch, and probably one of the fresher feeling movies I have seen recently, if you have the time you should check it out. 

I will be updating the look/feel of this very soon, as well as updating my main page.
