Hello readers,

past couple of days, I've been spending trying to make a Anime Api SPA App, but have run into error, after error. eslint on my app had problems with syntax, despite no syntax error existing. It was simply a weird package interaction, despite my best efforts to figure out the problem. I found that I could simply ignore the syntax error by adding this rule to my eslintrc file. 
```"no-unused-vars": "off"```

Other then that I've been reading about c, and c++ resources.

Have a great day!
